#
#   Comparative analysis evaluates two superconducting materials, one of which is 
#   LK-99 (while the other material might be YBCO or MgB₂). The program executes this
#   process by considering topological voids/channels using persistent homology from
#   topological data analysis, as well as electron-phonon coupling (EPC) and ℤ₂ 
#   invariants that are density functional theory outputs. The result is a CSV table
#   that includes these metrics, so that benchmarking can ensue. The input consists
#   CIFs for each material, such as LK-99.cif or YBCO.cif, while the output 
#   contains EPC and band structure results, generated using Quantum ESPRESSO.
