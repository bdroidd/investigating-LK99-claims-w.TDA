    "# Hubbard +U Correction Program for LK-99: Hubbard+UCorrection.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "The program below applies density functional theory (DFT) calculations with Hubbard U corrections (DFT+U) on a pre-relaxed LK-99 structure, so that the electronic\n",
    "properties of the material can be studied thoroughly. This code is particularly useful in evaluating the superconductivity of the LK-99 material. \n",
    "\n",
    "The results of Hubbard+UCorrection.ipynb contribute to the description of Cu-3d electrons, which proves to be relevant for determining the band structure near \n",
    "the Fermi level, for one. Flat bands may increase electron-phonon coupling or unconventional pairing. Additionally, such a description will aid in the \n",
    "identification of magnetic properties of LK-99, including $Cu^{2+}$ spin states might affect spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing. \n",
    "\n",
    "The program loads the relaxed LK-99 structure, reading the atomic position and lattice parameters from a particular output file that had been previously generated\n",
    "in a prior structural relaxation with the PBEsol functional. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is the establishment of the Hubbard U parameters, where a +U correction (of $5.0 eV$) is applied to Cu-3d orbitals so that electron localization is\n",
    "more seamlessly described. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generating the input for Quantum ESPRESSO follows from the previous step, which entails the use of pseudopotentials with the PBEsol exchange-correlation functional.\n",
    "DFT+U is equipped, which determines Hubbard U/J parameters for Cu. Also, the computational parameters, such as the energy cut-oofs, k-point gri, and smearing for \n",
    "metallic systems, are set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, the self-consistent field calculation (with U) is run via pw.x from QE. \n",
    "\n",
    "The program analyzes the results to ensure that each step was executed correctly. The total energy is then extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "DFT+U fixes self-cinteraction errors in classic density functional theory, specifically for localized d/f-electrons (such as Cu-3d in the material in focus, LK-99). \n",
    "The Hubbard term is given by \n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_{DFT+U} = E_{DFT} + \\frac{U - J}{2} \\Sigma_{\\sigma} (Tr [p^{\\sigma}]) - Tr[\\rho^{\\sigma} \\rho^{\\sigma}],$$\n",

    "such that $\\rho^{\\sigma}$ represents the density matrix for the spin, $\\sigma$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The PBEsol function is an updated Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional relevant for improve lattice parameter predictions for solids. \n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum ESPRESSO is a software suite that implements density functional theory, resolving the Kohn-Sham equations with plane-wave basis sets, as well as pseudo-\n",
    "potentials. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application to LK-99 for Superconductivity\n",
    "\n",
    "To continue with the evaluation of the LK-99 material for the superconductivity property, one must move on to perform phonon calculations, such as electron-phonon\n",
    "coupling strength, given by $\\lambda$, and the critical temperature, $T_c$, using the McMillan-Allen-Dynes formula. The Wannier functions can be used to construct\n",
    "tight-binding models to analyze the material further. \n"
